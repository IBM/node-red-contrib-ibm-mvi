### Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

node-red-contrib-ibm-mvi  have tried to make it as easy as possible to make contributions. This applies to how we handle the legal aspects of contribution. We use the same approach - the [DCO1.1.txt](DCO1.1.txt)  that the LinuxÂ® Kernel [community](https://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin) uses to manage code contributions. We simply ask that when submitting a patch for review, the developer must include a sign-off statement in the commit message. Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the submitter accepts the DCO:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

You can include this automatically when you commit a change to your local git repository using the following command:

```
git commit -s
```
